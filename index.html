         3.How do you create forms in React?

             < label>Input Value:< /label>
             < input  type="number"  value={num} onChange={handleChange} />

         4. Explain lifecycle methods.   
         
         
        In React, components have a lifecycle that consists of different phases. Each phase has a set of lifecycle methods that are called at specific points in the component's lifecycle. 
       These methods allow you to control the component's behavior and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle.
        
       A component's lifecycle has three main phases: 

          # the Mounting Phase,
          # the Updating Phase,
          # and the Unmounting Phase.

         5.Can web browsers read JSX directly?  


         Browsers cannot read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand it.
        You can use babel to transform your jsx into native javascript and HTML which browser can understand.
        React uses JSX (JavaScript eXtension) that allows us to write JavaScript that looks like HTML.

         6.How Do You Handle Forms in React?

        To handle form submission, you can use the handleSubmit function. In this example, we pass the onSubmit function to the handleSubmit function. 
        The onSubmit function will be called when the form is submitted and will receive an object containing the values of each form field.

         7.What is virtual dom in the react?    

         
        React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
       Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating,
       before making the changes in the browser DOM. React only changes what needs to be changed!

         8.In React, Why Is There a Need for Using Keys in Lists?

        # To provide a unique identity to each list element from lists.
        # To remove the warning or error that reacts if the key is not used.
        # It is used to identify which items have changed, updated, or deleted from the Lists.
        # It is useful when a user alters the list.
        # It helps react to determine which component to be re-rendered.

         9.What Is the Difference Between State and Props in React? 

         PROPS

        # The Data is passed from one component to another.
        # It is Immutable (cannot be modified).
        # Props can be used with state and functional components.
        # Props are read-only.
         
        STATE
         
        # The Data is passed within the component only.
        # The Data is passed within the component only.
        # The state can be used only with the state components/class component (Before 16.0).
        # The state is both read and write.
